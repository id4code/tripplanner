          TripPartner helps travelers find like-minded companions for multi-day trips. Unlike one-way ride apps,
          hosts publish detailed multi-day itineraries with day-wise plans. Travelers can join for the locations and
          dates that match their interests, making travel more social, affordable, and stress-free.

        <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
          Our mission is to unlock deeper local experiences, encourage sustainable shared travel, and make planning
          seamless through transparent itineraries and community ratings.
